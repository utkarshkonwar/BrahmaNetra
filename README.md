BrahmaNetra
- A Submission by the DcodeU team

In this comprehensive pseudocode document, we present a structured and versatile blueprint for developing a sophisticated web browser, BarhmaNetra with a rich set of features and functionalities. The pseudocode encompasses a wide range of essential features, such as navigation controls, search capabilities, and history management, ensuring seamless user interaction. It extends to incorporate advanced functionalities like voice search, QR code scanning, and PDF support, enhancing the overall browsing experience.

Moreover, the document delves into cutting-edge technologies, including Web3 support for blockchain interactions, ensuring the browser is not only modern but also equipped for decentralized applications. It also explores crucial privacy and security aspects with features like ad-blocking, data-saving mode, and incognito browsing. Furthermore, the pseudocode outlines parental controls, catering to a family-friendly browsing experience.

The provided pseudocode is adaptable and can serve as a foundation for a feature-rich, user-centric browser. It invites developers to implement, customize, and extend the functionality based on specific requirements and preferences. By following this roadmap, developers can craft a browser that aligns with modern standards while offering an array of options to cater to a diverse user base, ultimately shaping a compelling and robust browsing platform.

1. Project Setup and Infrastructure:
We choose a suitable programming language and framework for building the web browser, such as Electron.js for a cross-platform desktop application or a combination of React.js and Node.js for a web-based application.

Thereafter, We set up the project directory and version control system (e.g., Git).

2. Text Search:
Implement a search functionality within the browser using JavaScript for handling user input and searching through the webpage content.

1. Get user input for the search query.

2. Iterate through the webpage content:
   - Traverse all elements in the DOM (Document Object Model).
   - For each element, check if it contains the search query.

3. Display the search results:
   - If a match is found, highlight the matching content or display a list of matches.
   - Provide a way for the user to navigate through the search results (e.g., next, previous).

Pseudocode:

function searchAndHighlight(query) {
    // Get user input for the search query

    // Iterate through the webpage content
    let elements = document.querySelectorAll('*');

    for (let element of elements) {
        // Check if the element contains the search query
        if (element.textContent.includes(query)) {
            // Highlight the matching content or add to the search results list
            // You can modify this to suit your needs (e.g., highlighting the text)
            element.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
        }
    }

    // Display search results
    // You can create a list or display the results in a specific way
}

// Event listener for handling user input
document.getElementById('searchButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    let query = document.getElementById('searchInput').value;
    searchAndHighlight(query);
});

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we have a function searchAndHighlight that takes a search query as an argument. It iterates through all elements in the DOM, checks if the element contains the search query, and highlights the matching content (in this case, by changing the background color to yellow). The search is triggered when the user clicks a button with the ID 'searchButton', and the search query is obtained from an input field with the ID 'searchInput'. 

3. Voice Search:
Utilize Web Speech API or similar technologies to enable voice input for searching. Implement speech-to-text functionality.

1. Request microphone access and initialize Web Speech API.

2. Capture voice input and convert it to text using Web Speech API.

3. Use the text obtained from speech-to-text for the search.

Pseudocode:

function startVoiceSearch() {
    // Request microphone access
    navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
        .then(function(stream) {
            // Initialize speech recognition
            const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
            recognition.lang = 'en-US';

            // Event handler for when speech is recognized
            recognition.onresult = function(event) {
                const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript.trim();
                // Use the transcript for search
                performSearch(transcript);
            };

            // Start listening for speech
            recognition.start();
        })
        .catch

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we have a function startVoiceSearch that requests microphone access and initializes the Web Speech API's SpeechRecognition object. When speech is recognized, the onresult event is triggered, and the recognized transcript is used for performing the search by calling the performSearch function. The performSearch function is a placeholder for whatever functionality you want to implement to handle the search based on the recognized text.

The voice search is triggered when the user clicks a button with the ID 'voiceSearchButton'. 

4. QR Code Scanner:
Integrate a QR code scanner using a library like Instascan or QuaggaJS. Use the device's camera to capture and decode QR codes.

1. Initialize the camera and configure the QR code scanner using QuaggaJS.

2. Set up a callback function to handle QR code scanning results.

Pseudocode:

// Function to initialize the QR code scanner
function initializeQRScanner() {
    // Specify the target HTML element to attach the camera feed
    const scannerContainer = document.getElementById('scanner-container');

    // Initialize QuaggaJS scanner
    Quagga.init({
        inputStream: {
            name: "Live",
            type: "LiveStream",
            target: scannerContainer,
            constraints: {
                facingMode: "environment"  // Use the device's back camera
            },
        },
        decoder: {
            readers: ['code_128_reader'] // You can add more supported formats
        }
    }, function (err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Error initializing QR code scanner:', err);
            return;
        }

        // Start the scanner
        Quagga.start();
    });

    // Set up a callback for successful scans
    Quagga.onDetected(handleQRCode);
}

// Callback function to handle QR code scanning results
function handleQRCode(result) {
    // Process the QR code data (result.code) as needed
    console.log('QR Code scanned:', result.code);
}

// Event listener to start the QR code scanner
document.getElementById('startScannerButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    initializeQRScanner();
});

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we have a function initializeQRScanner that initializes the QR code scanner using QuaggaJS. It configures the scanner to use the device's back camera and specifies a target HTML element to display the camera feed. The handleQRCode function is a callback that gets executed when a QR code is successfully detected. You can process the QR code data as needed within this function.

The QR code scanning is triggered when the user clicks a button with the ID 'startScannerButton'. Also, we make sure to include the QuaggaJS library in the project for this to work.
5. History:
Implement a history system to record visited URLs and relevant information. Store the data in a local database or use browser storage.

1. Create a data structure to represent the history entry.

2. Implement functions to add a visited URL to the history and retrieve the history.

Pseudocode:

// Data structure for a history entry
class HistoryEntry {
    constructor(url, timestamp) {
        this.url = url;
        this.timestamp = timestamp;
    }
}

// Function to add a visited URL to the history
function addToHistory(url) {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const entry = new HistoryEntry(url, timestamp);

    // Retrieve the existing history from localStorage
    let existingHistory = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('history')) || [];
    
    // Add the new entry to the history
    existingHistory.push(entry);

    // Store the updated history back in localStorage
    localStorage.setItem('history', JSON.stringify(existingHistory));
}

// Function to retrieve the history
function getHistory() {
    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('history')) || [];
}

// Example usage: add a visited URL to the history
const visitedURL = 'https://example.com/page1';
addToHistory(visitedURL);

// Example usage: retrieve the history
const history = getHistory();
console.log('History:', history);

Pseudocode Description:

n this pseudocode, we define a HistoryEntry class to represent a history entry with a URL and a timestamp. We have functions addToHistory to add a visited URL to the history and getHistory to retrieve the history from localStorage.

You would call addToHistory whenever a user visits a new URL to record it in the history. To retrieve the history, you would call getHistory. The history is stored in localStorage, which persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.

6. Bookmark Management:
Create functionality to add, delete, and organize bookmarks. Store bookmark data in a local database.

1. Create a database schema for the bookmarks.

2. Implement functions to add, delete, and organize bookmarks using IndexedDB.

Pseudocode:

// Open or create the IndexedDB database
const dbPromise = indexedDB.open('bookmarkDB', 1);

// Event handler for initializing the database
dbPromise.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
    const db = event.target.result;
    
    // Create an object store for bookmarks
    const objectStore = db.createObjectStore('bookmarks', { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true });
    objectStore.createIndex('url', 'url', { unique: true });
};

// Function to add a bookmark
function addBookmark(url, title) {
    dbPromise.then(function(db) {
        const transaction = db.transaction('bookmarks', 'readwrite');
        const objectStore = transaction.objectStore('bookmarks');

        const bookmark = { url, title };
        objectStore.add(bookmark);

        return transaction.complete;
    }).then(function() {
        console.log('Bookmark added successfully.');
    }).catch(function(error) {
        console.error('Error adding bookmark:', error);
    });
}

// Function to delete a bookmark by its ID
function deleteBookmark(bookmarkId) {
    dbPromise.then(function(db) {
        const transaction = db.transaction('bookmarks', 'readwrite');
        const objectStore = transaction.objectStore('bookmarks');

        objectStore.delete(bookmarkId);

        return transaction.complete;
    }).then(function() {
        console.log('Bookmark deleted successfully.');
    }).catch(function(error) {
        console.error('Error deleting bookmark:', error);
    });
}

// Function to retrieve all bookmarks
function getAllBookmarks() {
    return dbPromise.then(function(db) {
        const transaction = db.transaction('bookmarks', 'readonly');
        const objectStore = transaction.objectStore('bookmarks');

        return objectStore.getAll();
    });
}

// Example usage: add a bookmark
const newBookmark = {
    url: 'https://example.com/page1',
    title: 'Example Page 1'
};
addBookmark(newBookmark.url, newBookmark.title);

// Example usage: delete a bookmark
const bookmarkIdToDelete = 1; // ID of the bookmark to delete
deleteBookmark(bookmarkIdToDelete);

// Example usage: retrieve all bookmarks
getAllBookmarks().then(function(bookmarks) {
    console.log('All bookmarks:', bookmarks);
});

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we define functions to add, delete, and retrieve bookmarks using IndexedDB. The bookmarks are stored in an IndexedDB database called 'bookmarkDB'. The addBookmark function adds a new bookmark, deleteBookmark deletes a bookmark by its ID, and getAllBookmarks retrieves all bookmarks.

7. Download Management:
Implement download functionality using appropriate HTML5 features. Manage and display download progress and completed downloads.

1. Create a function to initiate a download using the Fetch API.

2. Attach an event listener to track download progress.

3. Display the download progress to the user.

Pseudocode:

// Function to initiate a download using the Fetch API
function initiateDownload(url) {
    fetch(url)
        .then(response => {
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
            }
            return response.blob();
        })
        .then(blob => {
            // Create a link element to trigger the download
            const link = document.createElement('a');
            link.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
            link.download = 'downloaded_file';
            link.click();
            window.URL.revokeObjectURL(link.href);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Download failed:', error);
        });
}

// Event listener to trigger the download
document.getElementById('downloadButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    const downloadURL = 'https://example.com/file-to-download';
    initiateDownload(downloadURL);
});

// Function to update the download progress
function updateDownloadProgress(event) {
    if (event.lengthComputable) {
        const progressPercentage = Math.round((event.loaded / event.total) * 100);
        console.log('Download progress:', progressPercentage, '%');
        // Update UI to display the progress (e.g., a progress bar)
    }
}

// Example usage: Attach event listener to track download progress
fetch('https://example.com/file-to-download')
    .then(response => {
        const downloadButton = document.getElementById('downloadButton');
        response.body.on('progress', updateDownloadProgress);
        downloadButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
            initiateDownload('https://example.com/file-to-download');
        });
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error initiating download:', error);
    });

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we define a initiateDownload function that uses the Fetch API to download a file from a given URL. We attach an event listener to track the download progress and display it to the user. When the download is complete, we create a link element and simulate a click to initiate the download of the file.

The updateDownloadProgress function can be customized to update the UI based on the download progress (e.g., updating a progress bar).

8. Multiple Search Engine Options:
Allow users to select and switch between various search engines. Implement an option in settings to manage the default search engine.

1. Create a settings interface to allow users to select a default search engine.

2. Store the default search engine preference using local storage.

3. Implement a function to perform a search based on the selected search engine.

Pseudocode:

// Function to set the default search engine in settings
function setDefaultSearchEngine(engine) {
    localStorage.setItem('defaultSearchEngine', engine);
}

// Function to get the default search engine from settings
function getDefaultSearchEngine() {
    return localStorage.getItem('defaultSearchEngine') || 'google';
}

// Function to perform a search using the specified search engine
function performSearch(query) {
    const searchEngine = getDefaultSearchEngine();
    switch (searchEngine) {
        case 'google':
            window.location.href = `https://www.google.com/search?q=${query}`;
            break;
        case 'bing':
            window.location.href = `https://www.bing.com/search?q=${query}`;
            break;
        // Add cases for other search engines as needed
        default:
            console.error('Invalid search engine:', searchEngine);
    }
}

// Event listener for handling search input
document.getElementById('searchButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    const query = document.getElementById('searchInput').value;
    performSearch(query);
});

// Event listener for changing the default search engine
document.getElementById('searchEngineSelect').addEventListener('change', function() {
    const selectedEngine = this.value;
    setDefaultSearchEngine(selectedEngine);
});

Pseudocode Description:
In this pseudocode, we have functions to set and get the default search engine preference using local storage. The performSearch function directs the user's search to the selected search engine's search URL based on the default search engine preference.

To allow users to change the default search engine, we have an event listener for the search engine selection dropdown (searchEngineSelect). When the user selects a new search engine, we update the default search engine preference accordingly.

We can add more search engines and handle them in the performSearch function as needed. 

9. Anonymous Mode (Incognito Mode):
Create a mode that does not save browsing history, cookies, or other private data. Ensure user activities in this mode are not stored.

1. Provide a UI element to toggle between regular mode and anonymous mode.

2. Create functions to enable and disable anonymous mode.

3. Implement logic to prevent storing browsing history, cookies, and other private data in anonymous mode.

Pseudocode:

// Function to enable anonymous mode
function enableAnonymousMode() {
    // Disable storage of browsing history
    // Disable storage of cookies
    // Clear existing browsing history and cookies if needed
    // Update UI to reflect anonymous mode
}

// Function to disable anonymous mode
function disableAnonymousMode() {
    // Enable storage of browsing history
    // Enable storage of cookies
    // Update UI to reflect regular mode
}

// Event listener for toggling between anonymous mode and regular mode
document.getElementById('toggleAnonymousModeButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    const isAnonymousMode = // Determine if anonymous mode is currently enabled
    if (isAnonymousMode) {
        disableAnonymousMode();
    } else {
        enableAnonymousMode();
    }
});

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we define functions to enable and disable anonymous mode. In anonymous mode, we disable the storage of browsing history and cookies. You can also clear existing browsing history and cookies if needed. When the user toggles between anonymous mode and regular mode, we call the appropriate functions to update the storage settings and UI.

10. Tab Management:
Implement tab creation, switching, closing, and organizing features. Use a tab component and manage tab data.

1. Create a tab component to represent each tab.

2. Implement functions to create, switch, close, and organize tabs.

Pseudocode:

// Tab data structure
class Tab {
    constructor(id, title, content) {
        this.id = id;
        this.title = title;
        this.content = content;
    }
}

// Function to create a new tab
function createTab(title, content) {
    const id = Date.now(); // Generate a unique ID for the tab
    const tab = new Tab(id, title, content);

    // Create a tab element and display it in the UI
    displayTab(tab);
}

// Function to display a tab in the UI
function displayTab(tab) {
    // Create a tab element (HTML/CSS) and append it to the tab bar
    const tabElement = createTabElement(tab);

    // Add event listener to switch to this tab when clicked
    tabElement.addEventListener('click', function() {
        switchToTab(tab);
    });
}

// Function to switch to a specific tab
function switchToTab(tab) {
    // Display the content of the selected tab in the main content area
    displayTabContent(tab.content);

    // Highlight the selected tab in the UI
    highlightTab(tab);
}

// Function to close a tab
function closeTab(tab) {
    // Remove the tab element from the UI
    removeTabElement(tab);

    // Close any resources associated with the tab (optional)
}

// Function to organize tabs (e.g., reorder, group)
function organizeTabs() {
    // Implement tab organizing functionality as needed
}

// Example usage: create a new tab
const newTabTitle = 'New Tab';
const newTabContent = 'Content of the new tab.';
createTab(newTabTitle, newTabContent);

// Example usage: switch to a specific tab
const tabToSwitch = // Get a specific tab object
switchToTab(tabToSwitch);

// Example usage: close a specific tab
const tabToClose = // Get a specific tab object
closeTab(tabToClose);

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we define a Tab class to represent tab data. The createTab, displayTab, switchToTab, closeTab, and organizeTabs functions handle various tab management functionalities.

We would need to implement the details of displaying and managing the tab elements, content, and UI interactions based on your specific application and UI framework. Additionally, we must make sure to customize the HTML and CSS elements as per your UI requirements.

11. Navigation Features:
Implement forward and backward navigation, refresh, and stop functionalities using appropriate APIs and user interface elements.

1. Implement functions for forward, backward, refresh, and stop navigation.

2. Update the UI to reflect the navigation status.

Pseudocode:

// Function to navigate forward
function navigateForward() {
    window.history.forward();
}

// Function to navigate backward
function navigateBackward() {
    window.history.back();
}

// Function to refresh the page
function refreshPage() {
    window.location.reload();
}

// Function to stop the current navigation
function stopNavigation() {
    window.stop();
}

// Event listener for forward navigation button
document.getElementById('forwardButton').addEventListener('click', navigateForward);

// Event listener for backward navigation button
document.getElementById('backwardButton').addEventListener('click', navigateBackward);

// Event listener for refresh button
document.getElementById('refreshButton').addEventListener('click', refreshPage);

// Event listener for stop button
document.getElementById('stopButton').addEventListener('click', stopNavigation);

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we define functions for forward navigation, backward navigation, refreshing the page, and stopping the current navigation. We also attach event listeners to corresponding UI elements (e.g., buttons) to trigger these functions when clicked.

12. Address Bar:
Create an address bar for users to input URLs. Implement auto-suggestions and URL validation.

1. Create an input field for the address bar.

2. Implement functions for URL validation and auto-suggestions.

Pseudocode:

// Function to validate a URL
function isValidURL(url) {
    const urlPattern = /^https?:\/\/[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*$/i;
    return urlPattern.test(url);
}

// Function to provide auto-suggestions based on user input
function provideSuggestions(userInput) {
    // Implement logic to provide suggestions based on userInput
    // Suggestions can be from a predefined list, history, or a search API
    // Display the suggestions in a dropdown or a list
}

// Event listener for handling user input in the address bar
document.getElementById('addressInput').addEventListener('input', function(event) {
    const userInput = event.target.value;
    
    // Validate the URL
    const isValid = isValidURL(userInput);

    // Display the validation result to the user (e.g., change border color)
    const addressBar = document.getElementById('addressInput');
    addressBar.style.borderColor = isValid ? 'green' : 'red';

    // Provide auto-suggestions based on user input
    provideSuggestions(userInput);
});

// Event listener for handling submission of the address bar (Enter key)
document.getElementById('addressInput').addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
        const userInput = event.target.value;

        // Validate the URL before proceeding
        if (isValidURL(userInput)) {
            // Navigate to the entered URL
            window.location.href = userInput;
        } else {
            console.error('Invalid URL. Please enter a valid URL.');
        }
    }
});

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we define functions for URL validation and providing auto-suggestions based on user input. We also attach event listeners to handle user input and submission (Enter key) in the address bar. The address bar's border color changes based on the URL's validation result.

We can customize the provideSuggestions function to suit your application's needs for suggesting URLs based on user input. 

13. FAQ & Help:
Create a section within the browser with frequently asked questions and helpful information to assist users.

1. Create an HTML structure for the FAQ section.

2. Implement functions to show and hide FAQ answers.

Pseudocode:

// Function to toggle the visibility of FAQ answers
function toggleFAQAnswer(faqId) {
    const answerElement = document.getElementById(`faqAnswer_${faqId}`);
    answerElement.classList.toggle('show');
}

// Event listener to handle FAQ answer toggling
document.querySelectorAll('.faqQuestion').forEach(function(question) {
    question.addEventListener('click', function() {
        const faqId = question.getAttribute('data-faq-id');
        toggleFAQAnswer(faqId);
    });
});

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we define a toggleFAQAnswer function to toggle the visibility of FAQ answers when the user clicks on a question. We attach event listeners to FAQ questions to call this function when clicked.

We can customize the FAQ content and CSS styles to match your application's needs. 

14. Multi-lingual Support:
Provide language options for users to select their preferred language. Implement translation features if necessary.

1. Define translations for different languages.

2. Implement a function to set the language based on user selection.

3. Implement a function to translate UI elements.

Pseudocode:

// Translation data for different languages
const translations = {
    en: {
        welcome: 'Welcome',
        hello: 'Hello',
        goodbye: 'Goodbye'
    },
    es: {
        welcome: 'Bienvenido',
        hello: 'Hola',
        goodbye: 'Adiós'
    },
    // Add translations for more languages as needed
};

let currentLanguage = 'en'; // Default language is English

// Function to set the current language based on user selection
function setLanguage(language) {
    currentLanguage = language;
    translateUI();
}

// Function to translate UI elements
function translateUI() {
    const elementsToTranslate = document.querySelectorAll('[data-i18n]');
    elementsToTranslate.forEach(element => {
        const translationKey = element.getAttribute('data-i18n');
        const translation = translations[currentLanguage][translationKey];
        if (translation) {
            element.innerText = translation;
        }
    });
}

// Event listener for language selection
document.getElementById('languageSelect').addEventListener('change', function() {
    const selectedLanguage = this.value;
    setLanguage(selectedLanguage);
});

// Example HTML structure for language selection dropdown:
// <select id="languageSelect">
//     <option value="en">English</option>
//     <option value="es">Español</option>
//     <!-- Add more language options as needed -->
// </select>

// Example usage: translate UI elements initially
translateUI();

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we define translations for different languages and create functions to set the language based on user selection and translate UI elements accordingly. We use data-i18n attributes to mark elements for translation.

We must customize the translations and language options to match your application's supported languages in later implementations. 

15. Trust Store:
Implement a trust store to manage SSL certificates for secure browsing.

Integrating a Trust Store for SSL certificates in a browser involves managing a repository of trusted SSL certificates, ensuring secure connections between the browser and websites. Below is a high-level description and pseudocode outlining the basic steps to achieve this integration:

Description:

Initialize Trust Store: Set up a trust store where SSL certificates from trusted certificate authorities (CAs) will be stored.
Fetch SSL Certificates: Retrieve SSL certificates from trusted CAs and add them to the trust store.
SSL Certificate Validation: During HTTPS connections, validate the SSL certificate presented by the website against the certificates stored in the trust store.
Trust Verification: Verify that the certificate presented by the website is signed by a trusted CA, ensuring a secure and trusted connection.

Pseudocode:

1. Create a TrustStore object to hold SSL certificates.

2. Initialize the TrustStore by loading certificates from trusted CAs.

3. When making an HTTPS connection:
   a. Retrieve the SSL certificate presented by the website.
   b. Verify if the certificate is present in the TrustStore.
   c. If the certificate is found and valid, proceed with the secure connection.

Use semantic HTML elements to provide a clear structure and meaningful information to assistive technologies. Proper use of headings, lists, landmarks, and other semantic elements is crucial.

Keyboard Accessibility:
Ensure that all functionalities can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard. This includes navigating through the browser, accessing links, submitting forms, and using all features without a mouse.

Focus Management:
Maintain a clear and visible focus indicator to show where keyboard focus is. Users should be able to navigate through interactive elements using the keyboard easily.

Contrast and Color:
Use sufficient color contrast to make content easily readable for users with visual impairments. Follow established standards for contrast ratios.

Alternative Text for Images:
Provide descriptive alternative text for images to ensure users with vision impairments understand the content conveyed by the images.

Aria Roles and Attributes:
Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility and provide additional information to assistive technologies.

Accessible Forms:
Ensure forms are accessible by providing clear labels, instructions, and proper error messages. Use appropriate form elements and group related form controls together.

ARIA Landmarks:
Utilize ARIA landmarks to help users navigate through different sections of the browser easily.

Screen Reader Testing:
Regularly test your browser using screen reader software to ensure that users with visual impairments can access and interact with the content effectively.

Testing with Assistive Technologies:

    pdfjsLib.getDocument(pdfUrl).promise.then(function(pdfDoc) {
        const numPages = pdfDoc.numPages;

        // Display each page of the PDF
        for (let pageNum = 1; pageNum <= numPages; pageNum++) {
            pdfDoc.getPage(pageNum).then(function(page) {
                const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
                pdfContainer.appendChild(canvas);
                const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
                const viewport = page.getViewport({ scale: 1.5 });
                canvas.height = viewport.height;
                canvas.width = viewport.width;

                // Render the page content on the canvas
                page.render({
                    canvasContext: context,
                    viewport: viewport
                });
            });
        }
    });
}

// Example usage: Load a PDF file
const pdfUrl = 'path/to/your/pdf.pdf';
loadPDF(pdfUrl);

Pseudocode Description:

In this pseudocode, we define a loadPDF function to load and render a PDF using PDF.js. We loop through each page of the PDF, render it on a canvas, and display it in the PDF container.
